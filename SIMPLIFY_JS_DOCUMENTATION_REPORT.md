- **@commented_out_code**: Detailed analysis of disabled code sections

## üî¨ **Complex Logic Documentation Highlights**

### **1. Douglas-Peucker Mathematical Foundation**
```javascript
/**
 * @mathematical_foundation
 * Based on perpendicular distance from points to line segments:
 * - **Distance Metric**: Shortest distance from point to line segment
 * - **Significance Test**: Distance > tolerance indicates geometric importance
 * - **Recursive Subdivision**: Split polygon at most significant deviations
 * - **Optimal Preservation**: Maintains maximum shape fidelity with minimum points
 */
```

### **2. Point-to-Segment Distance Algorithm**
```javascript
/**
 * @mathematical_background
 * Uses vector projection formula: t = (p-p1)¬∑(p2-p1) / |p2-p1|¬≤
 * Where t represents position along segment (0=start, 1=end)
 * Clamping ensures closest point lies on segment, not infinite line.
 */
```

### **3. Performance Optimization Strategy**
```javascript
/**
 * @performance_strategy
 * **Combined Algorithm Benefits**:
 * - **Speed**: 5-10x faster than Douglas-Peucker alone on complex polygons
 * - **Quality**: Nearly identical to pure Douglas-Peucker results
 * - **Scalability**: Handles very large polygons (100K+ points) efficiently
 * - **Adaptive**: More benefit on complex shapes, minimal overhead on simple ones
 */
```

## üîç **Commented Code Analysis**

### **1. Marked Point Handling (Commented Out)**
```javascript
/**
 * @commented_out_code MARKED_POINT_HANDLING
 * @reason: Alternative marked point preservation strategy
 * @explanation:
 * This code would force preservation of marked points even when they don't
 * exceed the distance tolerance. It was likely commented out because:
 * 1. It conflicts with the Douglas-Peucker algorithm's core principle
 * 2. Marked points are already handled in the radial distance preprocessing
 * 3. DP algorithm should focus purely on geometric significance
 * 4. Alternative marked point handling may be implemented elsewhere
 */
```

### **2. Debug Assertion (Commented Out)**
```javascript
/**
 * @commented_out_code DEBUG_ASSERTION
 * @reason: Debug assertion for development error detection
 * @explanation:
 * This debug assertion was checking for an inconsistent state where:
 * - A maximum distance exceeds tolerance (point should be preserved)
 * - But no valid index was found (points[index] is undefined)
 * 
 * @why_commented:
 * 1. Debug code not needed in production
 * 2. Crude error message not appropriate for production code
 * 3. This condition should theoretically never occur with correct logic
 * 4. If it did occur, it would indicate a serious algorithm bug
 */
```
