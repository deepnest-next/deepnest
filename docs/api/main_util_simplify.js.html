   * Performs basic distance-based polygon simplification using radial filtering.

   * @param {number} sqTolerance - Squared distance tolerance for point removal

   * 1. Always keep first point as reference

   *    c. Otherwise discard as redundant
   * 3. Ensure last point is included if different from last kept point
   * 
   * @marking_system
   * Points can have a 'marked' property to indicate geometric importance:
   * - Marked points are always preserved regardless of distance
   * - Used to preserve sharp corners, direction changes, or critical features
   * - Allows feature-aware simplification beyond pure distance filtering
   * 
   * @performance
   * - Time Complexity: O(n) where n is number of input points
   * - Space Complexity: O(k) where k is number of kept points
   * - Very fast preprocessing step, typically reduces points by 30-70%
   * 
   * @geometric_properties
   * - Preserves polygon topology (no self-intersections introduced)
   * - Maintains overall shape while removing close-together vertices
   * - May miss important features if tolerance too large
   * - Conservative approach - never removes critical boundary points
   * 
   * @tolerance_guidance
   * - Small tolerance (0.1-1.0): Preserves fine detail, minimal reduction
   * - Medium tolerance (1.0-5.0): Good balance of detail vs simplification
   * - Large tolerance (5.0+): Aggressive reduction, may lose important features
   * 
   * @preprocessing_context
   * Used as first stage in two-stage simplification:
   * 1. Radial distance filtering (this function) - fast O(n) preprocessing
   * 2. Douglas-Peucker algorithm - slower O(n log n) but higher quality

   * 
   * @algorithm
   * 1. **Find Critical Point**: Locate point with maximum distance from first-last line
   * 2. **Distance Check**: If max distance > tolerance, point is significant
   * 3. **Recursive Division**: Split segment at critical point and recurse on both halves
   * 4. **Point Addition**: Add critical point to simplified result
