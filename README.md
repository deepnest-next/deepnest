# **deepnest**

A fast open source nesting tool for plotter, laser cutters and other CNC tools

deepnest is a desktop application originally based on [SVGNest](https://github.com/Jack000/SVGnest) and [deepnest](https://github.com/Jack000/Deepnest)

- New nesting engine with speed-critical code, written in C (outsourced to an external NodeJs module)
- Merging of common lines for plotter and laser cuts
- Support for DXF files (through conversion)
- New path approximation function for highly complex parts



## Upcoming changes
- more speed with code written in Rust outsourced as modules, the original code was written in JavaScript
- some core libraries rewritten from scratch in Rust so we get even more speed and ensure memory safety
- Save and load settings as presets
- Load nesting projects via CSV or JSON
- Native support of DXF file formats without online conversion
- **Cloud nesting:** Use our cloud for fast nesting of your projects _more soon_
