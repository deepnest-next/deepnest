Since there were no changes after the usual up to 60 minutes. So I quickly put together an API for you. Actually I wasn't ready yet, but after 8 hours I could at least report a success for my tests and provide instructions on how you can overwrite the converter until the next update</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;\">You can find more information at: <a href=\"https://github.com/deepnest-next/deepnest/issues/71#issuecomment-2744963030\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;\">GitHub comment</a></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #777; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;\">Greetings, Josef<br>From your deepnest-next team!</p>\n"
